In this type of problems we partition the array into 2 parts and then we get the based possible of the asked value from the partitions

The rules to solve this type of problems are as follows:
1) start with the entire block / array
2) try out all the partitions
3) take the best possible partition

// for the matrix chain multiplication , this all rules are used

// for the tabulation in the mcm type problems we use the bottom up approach to solve the problems
