In this type of problems we partition the array into 2 parts and then we get the based possible of the asked value from the partitions

The rules to solve this type of problems are as follows:
1) start with the entire block / array
2) try out all the partitions
3) take the best possible partition

// for the matrix chain multiplication , this all rules are used

// for the tabulation in the mcm type problems we use the bottom up approach to solve the problems

The problems that are similar to the mcm problem






The problems that are similar the front end partitioning are as follows:
In the palindrome partitioning problem , we do the partitioning from the front end and not from both the ends as in the mcm or the boolean parenthesis problem


For all the dp problems , we solved them using the recursion and then using the tabulation and space optimization for the particular problem, but in the case of finding the number of squares in the total matrix , we use the tabulation code and do not use the recursive approach

The maximum rectangles in the case of the matrix problem can be solved using the approach which is very similar to the approach of the finding the maximum rectangle in the case of the histogram
