In this type of problems we partition the array into 2 parts and then we get the based possible of the asked value from the partitions

The rules to solve this type of problems are as follows:
1) start with the entire block / array
2) try out all the partitions
3) take the best possible partition

// for the matrix chain multiplication , this all rules are used

// for the tabulation in the mcm type problems we use the bottom up approach to solve the problems

The problems that are similar to the mcm problem






The problems that are similar the front end partitioning are as follows:
In the palindrome partitioning problem , we do the partitioning from the front end and not from both the ends as in the mcm or the boolean parenthesis problem
